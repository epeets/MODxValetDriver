# MODxValetDriver
A Laravel Valet driver for the MODx CMS

This is a simple driver to enable the MODx CMS to run under Laravel Valet. Valet is a minimal development environment for MacOS which enables a developer to get a development environment set up fast and run fast. See https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/valet for more info.

The driver was based on the Valet Wordpress driver by [Adam Wathan](https://github.com/adamwathan)

To use - clone the repo, and after installing Valet, copy the driver file to ~/.valet/Drivers. No configuration needed.

Fastest way to get a site up and running:

1. Create a directory, cd in and valet link
2. Gitify install:modx
3. Log into the manager at directory.dev/manager
